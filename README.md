# How much framework? 

Choosing a framework is not an easy task: How good is the documentation? 
How many developers are actively working on it and how long has it been around?

Interesting and valid questions but not necessarily the most important ones. How
much of a framework do we actually need? And how crucial will it be for our
application? In this session, we’ll try to answer these two questions in a
potentially surprising way: by implementing our own micro framework from scratch
 – in 45 minutes!
